# Week 8 - Network Security: Protocol Vulnerabilities and Threats

## 1. Key Security Terms
- **Vulnerability**:
  - A vulnerability is a weakness in a system or network that attackers can exploit to cause harm.
  - Example: An outdated software version without security patches is vulnerable to attacks.

- **Threat**:
  - A potential cause of harm to a system, organization, or data, such as hackers or natural disasters.
  - Example: A threat could be an attacker trying to gain unauthorized access to a system.

- **Cyber Risk**:
  - The potential that a threat could exploit a vulnerability, resulting in loss or damage to data, systems, or reputation.

## 2. Internet Protocol (IP) Vulnerabilities
- **IP Protocol Basics**:
  - The **Internet Protocol (IP)** is responsible for routing packets across networks.
  - **Key Fields in the IP Header**:
    - **Version**: Indicates IPv4 or IPv6.
    - **TTL (Time to Live)**: Limits the lifespan of a packet to prevent infinite loops.
    - **Checksum**: Detects errors in the header.

- **IP Vulnerabilities**:
  - **IP Spoofing**:
    - Attackers send packets with a fake source IP address, disguising their identity.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
    - Attackers flood a network with traffic, overwhelming systems and causing downtime.

## 3. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- **Purpose of ARP**:
  - Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses within a Local Area Network (LAN).
  - **ARP Process**:
    - **Direct Delivery**: If sender and receiver are on the same network, the sender requests the MAC address of the receiver.
    - **Indirect Delivery**: If sender and receiver are on different networks, the sender first gets the MAC address of the gateway (router) to forward packets.

- **ARP Vulnerabilities**:
  - **ARP Poisoning (ARP Spoofing)**:
    - Attackers send fake ARP messages, associating their MAC address with the IP of another device, often to intercept traffic (Man-in-the-Middle attack).

## 4. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- **ICMP Role**:
  - ICMP is a supporting protocol used for error messages and diagnostics (e.g., **ping** and **traceroute**).
  - **Common ICMP Messages**:
    - **Echo Request/Reply**: Used by `ping` to check if a device is reachable.
    - **Destination Unreachable**: Indicates that a destination cannot be reached.
    - **Time Exceeded**: Sent when a packetâ€™s TTL (Time to Live) expires.

- **ICMP Vulnerabilities**:
  - **ICMP Redirect Attack**:
    - Attackers use ICMP messages to reroute packets to a different location.
  - **Ping of Death**:
    - An attacker sends an oversized packet to cause a buffer overflow, potentially crashing the target system.

## 5. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- **TCP Features**:
  - **Reliable and Connection-Oriented**: Ensures data reaches its destination in the correct order.
  - **Three-Way Handshake**:
    1. **SYN**: The client sends a synchronization request.
    2. **SYN-ACK**: The server acknowledges and syncs back.
    3. **ACK**: The client confirms, and the connection is established.
  - **Four-Way Termination**:
    - Used to close a TCP connection, involving a sequence of `FIN` (finish) and `ACK` messages.

- **TCP Vulnerabilities**:
  - **SYN Flooding**:
    - Attackers initiate many connections without completing them, overloading the server and causing denial of service.
  - **Sequence Prediction**:
    - Attackers predict sequence numbers to hijack a TCP session, inserting malicious data.

## 6. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- **DHCP Role**:
  - DHCP assigns IP addresses to devices automatically, simplifying network management.
  - **DHCP Lease Process**:
    1. **DHCPDISCOVER**: The client requests an IP address.
    2. **DHCPOFFER**: The server offers an IP address.
    3. **DHCPREQUEST**: The client accepts the offer.
    4. **DHCPACK**: The server confirms and finalizes the lease.

- **DHCP Vulnerabilities**:
  - **DHCP Spoofing**:
    - Attackers set up a fake DHCP server to assign malicious network settings, such as a false default gateway.
  - **DHCP Starvation Attack**:
    - Attackers flood the server with requests until it runs out of IP addresses, preventing legitimate clients from connecting.

---

## 7. Domain Name System (DNS)
- **DNS Purpose**:
  - Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses.

- **DNS Vulnerabilities**:
  - **DNS Cache Poisoning**:
    - Attackers insert false DNS entries, redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - **DNS Flood Attack**:
    - Overwhelms DNS servers with excessive requests, causing denial of service.

## 8. Types of Security Attacks
- **Active Attacks**:
  - Involve data modification or malicious insertion into a network. Examples include:
    - **Masquerade**: Attacker impersonates another user.
    - **Replay Attack**: Attacker intercepts and retransmits messages to gain unauthorized access.
    - **Modification of Messages**: Altering data in transit.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**: Overwhelming a network or system to disrupt service.

- **Passive Attacks**:
  - Attacks that monitor or capture data without altering it, such as:
    - **Traffic Analysis**: Monitoring data flow to infer information.
    - **Eavesdropping**: Listening in on private communication.
